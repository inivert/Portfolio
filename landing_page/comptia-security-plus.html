                question: "What is the main difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?",
                options: [
                    "Symmetric encryption is faster, asymmetric is more secure",
                    "Symmetric uses one key, asymmetric uses two keys",
                    "Symmetric is used for storing data, asymmetric for transmitting",
                    "Symmetric works on larger files, asymmetric on smaller ones"
                ],
                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanations: [
                    "Incorrect. While symmetric encryption is generally faster, this is not the main difference, and asymmetric isn't necessarily more secure.",
                    "Correct! The main difference is that symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.",
                    "Incorrect. Both types can be used for storing and transmitting data, depending on the specific use case.",
                    "Incorrect. The size of the file doesn't determine which type of encryption is used, although symmetric encryption is often more efficient for larger amounts of data."

                correctAnswer: 1,
                explanations: [
                    "Incorrect. A DMZ doesn't completely isolate the internal network; it provides a controlled interface.",
                    "Correct! A DMZ is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to an untrusted network, usually the internet. It acts as a buffer zone between the internal and external networks.",
                    "Incorrect. While a DMZ can help manage traffic, its primary purpose is not to speed up data transfer.",
                    "Incorrect. Encrypting network traffic is not the primary purpose of a DMZ, although encryption may be used within a DMZ."

                explanations: [
                    "Correct! The primary goal of a penetration test is to identify security weaknesses in a system by simulating an attack to exploit vulnerabilities, helping organizations improve their security posture.",
                    "Incorrect. While penetration tests can provide valuable learning experiences, training personnel is not their primary goal.",
